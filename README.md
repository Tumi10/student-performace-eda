# ðŸ“Š Student Performance Analysis (Python EDA)  

This repository contains an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** project using Python to analyze a **student performance dataset**. The dataset includes subject scores (Math, Physics, Chemistry), grades, school names, comments, and student details. The aim is to explore academic trends, identify top performers, detect at-risk students, and gain insights useful for school performance monitoring.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries  
- **Python 3**  
- **Pandas** â†’ data cleaning & wrangling  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** â†’ visualizations  
- **NumPy** â†’ numerical analysis  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Workflow  
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers  
   - Standardized grades and normalized comments  
   - Created new features like `Avg_Score`  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Grade distribution across students  
   - Subject-wise score analysis (Math, Physics, Chemistry)  
   - Correlation between subjects  
   - School-level performance comparison  
   - Identification of top performers and at-risk students  

3. **Visualizations**  
   - **Barplots** â†’ average scores per subject  
   - **Histograms** â†’ score distributions  
   - **Boxplots** â†’ subject variation and outliers  
   - **Heatmaps** â†’ subject correlations  

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Example Insights  
- Which subject has the highest and lowest average scores  
- Percentage of students in each grade category  
- Which schools consistently produce top performers  
- How strongly subjects (Math, Physics, Chemistry) are correlated
